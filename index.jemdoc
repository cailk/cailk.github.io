== Biography
I just voluntarily withdrew from the Ph.D. program in Computer Science at Fudan University for personal reasons. However, I am still passionate about doing research work. *I am actively looking for potential research labs to continue my doctoral study*. Prior to that, I obtained my Master’s degree in Computer Science from [https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/ ShanghaiTech University] in 2020 under the supervision of [https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/2020/0814/c7582a54749/page.htm Prof. Ning Cai], and my Bachelor’s degree in Spatial Information and Digital Technology from [https://en.xidian.edu.cn/ Xidian University] in 2017. I have worked as a research intern at Amazon AI Lab (with [https://bryanyzhu.github.io/ Yi Zhu], [https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nZr0oXQAAAAJ&hl=en Zhi Zhang] & [https://www.linkedin.com/in/mulicmu/ Mu Li]) and Tencent GYLab (with [https://www.skicyyu.org/ Gang Yu]).
