## Biography

<img class="profile-picture" src="./resources/my_pic.jpg">

I just quit the PhD study at Fudan University, and I am looking for potential research labs for continuing my study. 
Before that, I obtained M.S. in Computer Science from ShanghaiTech University advised by [Ning Cai](https://sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/sist_en/2020/0814/c7582a54749/page.htm) and B.E. in Spatial Information and Digital Technology from Xidian University.

## Research Interests

I am currently interested in Deep Learning and Computer Vision. My previous research work focuses specifically on large scale pre-training pipeline for object detection, combination of information theory and machine learning, generative models and adversarial attacks.
